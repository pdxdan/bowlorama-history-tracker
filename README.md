# dynamojo

A standalone exercise in working with the dynamodb-local version of DynamoDB
This code implements and tests the schema needed for serverless bowlorama

## Usage

The integration tests expect that you have dynamodb-local installed under:
/usr/local/bin/dynamodb-local
which is where "brew install dynamodb-local" would put it on OSX
